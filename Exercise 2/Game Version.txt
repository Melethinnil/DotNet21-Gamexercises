You're an administrator for an upcoming event, responsible for managing information about reservations
	Information: First name, last name, customer id, "ticket level" (silver/gold/platinum), discount code (different depending on ticket level), special notes (requests/allergies/etc)
	Discount codes need to be generated after adding the attendee, and must be unique to each attendee

You need to take information from incoming messages from attendees, which come automatically, and then input that information into the system
	this information is sometimes incorrect or incomplete, and you then need to contact the attendee and get the correct information
		sometimes however, information may appear to be incorrect (such as an alternative spelling of a name), but it in fact is correct

information gained from attendees can be written in different ways, such as them sometimes giving their age and sometimes their birth date

Attendees sometimes also contact you and want to change something or remove their reservation, which you need to do

When you send a message to a customer, they take a random amount of time to reply

You need to add whether each attendee has any allergies or not
	They don't always give this information in the first message
	sometimes they say "I don't have any allergies", to give you a hint that you should make sure to ask if they don't say anything

the event has an age limit, which means you need to reject reservations from underage attendees
	though be careful that they didn't just accidentally give the wrong age
		for example, they might give both birth year and age but they wrote one of them wrong, then you have to find out which

At the end, you want to have as many attendees as possible without having any incorrect information
	you'll get negative points for any missing information or incorrect information that you forgot to change
	you'll get negative points for underage attendees in the system, and also for rejected attendees that weren't actually underage
	you also get negative points for reservations that were supposed to be removed but are still in the system

Everything you do is through writing input commands, which need to be very exact (this is the difficulty element)

Customers have a unique ID number, which you use in your commands to reference that customer
	this ID is shown in messages, attendee list etc
	there is no programmatic link that keeps message ID and attendee ID the same

Each screen method only loops until a valid command for that screen has been entered, it then returns the command for the GameService to handle

Each screen has a different text color

When the game ends, you get the option to save your stats in a text file, either in a default location or a location of your choice
